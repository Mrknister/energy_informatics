The subfolders in this directory contain the computation benchmarks on the x86 and the raspberry pi platform. The directories all_features contain computations where the threshold is set so that all periods a recognized as features. The no_features folders contain benchmarks with thresholds that recognize no periods as events. In the raspberry folder are also benchmarks with a low but reasonable threshold. It has many false positives but is none the less interesting.
